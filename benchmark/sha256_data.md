## Benchmark Details

- Setup time: the time before step 5 finish.
- Witness generation time: the time between end of step 6 and step 8.
- Proof generation time: the time between end of step 6 and step 10.
- Verification time: running time of step 11.
- Peak memory: the peak memory usage of your program.
- Proof size: the byte length of the proof.
